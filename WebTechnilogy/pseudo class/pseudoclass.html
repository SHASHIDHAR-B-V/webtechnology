      A "pseudo-class" in computer science and programming typically refers to a
      class-like construct that is used to group elements or objects based on
      certain criteria or conditions. Pseudo-classes are commonly used in CSS to
      apply styles to HTML elements based on their state or characteristics
      (e.g., :hover, :active, :first-child). However, in other programming
      contexts, pseudo-classes can have different meanings. Here are some common
      types of pseudo-classes:
      <br />
      1. CSS Pseudo-classes: - :hover: Applies styles when the mouse pointer is
      over an element. - :active: Applies styles when an element is actively
      being clicked or interacted with. - :focus: Applies styles when an element
      receives keyboard focus or is clicked. - :nth-child(): Selects elements
      based on their position within a parent element (e.g., :nth-child(odd)). -
      :not(): Excludes elements from selection that match a specified selector.
      - :first-child: Selects the first child element of a parent element. -
      :last-child: Selects the last child element of a parent element. -
      :nth-of-type(): Selects elements of a certain type based on their position
      within a parent element. - :first-of-type: Selects the first element of a
      specified type within a parent element. - :last-of-type: Selects the last
      element of a specified type within a parent element.
      <br />
      2. JavaScript Pseudo-classes: - :hover (JavaScript): Used in JavaScript to
      handle mouseover events. - :active (JavaScript): Used in JavaScript to
      handle click events. - :focus (JavaScript): Used in JavaScript to handle
      focus events.
      <br />
      3. Database Pseudo-classes: - :not() (SQL): Used in SQL queries to filter
      out rows based on specified conditions.
      <br />
      4. Python Pseudo-classes: - metaclass: In Python, metaclasses can be
      considered a form of pseudo-class. They define the behavior of classes,
      allowing you to customize class creation and behavior.
      <br />
      5. Ruby Pseudo-classes: - Singleton Class: In Ruby, every object has a
      singleton class associated with it, which can be considered a form of
      pseudo-class. It allows you to define methods and attributes that apply
      only to a single instance of an object.
      <br />
      These are just a few examples of pseudo-classes in various programming and
      styling contexts. The specific usage and meaning of pseudo-classes can
      vary depending on the programming language or technology being used.
